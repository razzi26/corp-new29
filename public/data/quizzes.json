      {
        "id": "q1",
        "prompt": "What is the primary purpose of using a biosafety cabinet (BSC)?",
        "options": [
          { "id": "A", "label": "To maintain a sterile workspace for protecting the culture only." },
          { "id": "B", "label": "To provide a controlled temperature for cell growth." },
          { "id": "C", "label": "To create an aseptic environment that protects both the user and the cell culture from contamination." },
          { "id": "D", "label": "To mix cell culture media efficiently." }
        ],
        "answerId": "C",
        "explanation": "While sterility is key, a BSC’s HEPA filter and unidirectional airflow protect the user from aerosols generated by the culture and protect the culture from contaminants in the environment."
      },
      {
        "id": "q2",
        "prompt": "What is the standard concentration of CO2 used in a mammalian cell culture incubator to maintain physiological pH?",
        "options": [
          { "id": "A", "label": "5%" },
          { "id": "B", "label": "10%" },
          { "id": "C", "label": "21% (atmospheric)" },
          { "id": "D", "label": "0.5%" }
        ],
        "answerId": "A",
        "explanation": "A 5% CO2 atmosphere works with a sodium bicarbonate buffer system in the media to maintain a pH of ~7.4, essential for most mammalian cells."
      },
      {
        "id": "q3",
        "prompt": "When passaging adherent cells, the enzyme trypsin is commonly used. What is its specific function?",
        "options": [
          { "id": "A", "label": "To provide nutrients to the cells." },
          { "id": "B", "label": "To digest proteins that attach cells to the culture vessel surface." },
          { "id": "C", "label": "To neutralize the cell culture media." },
          { "id": "D", "label": "To sterilize the culture." }
        ],
        "answerId": "B",
        "explanation": "Trypsin is a protease that cleaves adhesion proteins, allowing adherent cells to detach and be resuspended for subculturing (passaging)."
      },
      {
        "id": "q4",
        "prompt": "What is the key advantage of using a defined, serum-free cell culture media over media containing fetal bovine serum (FBS)?",
        "options": [
          { "id": "A", "label": "It is always less expensive." },
          { "id": "B", "label": "It eliminates batch-to-batch variability and reduces risk of contamination from animal products." },
          { "id": "C", "label": "It requires less frequent media changes." },
          { "id": "D", "label": "It is only suitable for bacterial cell culture." }
        ],
        "answerId": "B",
        "explanation": "FBS is a complex, undefined mixture. Defined, serum-free media offer greater consistency, improved reproducibility, and reduced contamination risk for therapeutic applications."
      },
      {
        "id": "q5",
        "prompt": "Cryopreservation of cells typically involves suspending them in a medium containing a cryoprotectant like DMSO. What is the critical step immediately following the freezing process to ensure high cell viability upon thawing?",
        "options": [
          { "id": "A", "label": "Storing the vials at -20°C." },
          { "id": "B", "label": "Rapidly thawing the cells in a 37°C water bath." },
          { "id": "C", "label": "Slowly cooling the cells at a controlled rate (e.g., -1°C/minute) before long-term storage in liquid nitrogen." },
          { "id": "D", "label": "Exposing the cells to UV light." }
        ],
        "answerId": "C",
        "explanation": "Controlled-rate freezing prevents the formation of intracellular ice crystals, which are lethal to cells. This step is crucial for maximizing post-thaw viability."
      },
      {
        "id": "q6",
        "prompt": "In a bioreactor for large-scale cell culture, what is the primary function of controlling dissolved oxygen (DO)?",
        "options": [
          { "id": "A", "label": "To control the pH of the culture." },
          { "id": "B", "label": "To ensure adequate oxygen supply for cellular respiration, critical for cell growth and productivity." },
          { "id": "C", "label": "To prevent the media from evaporating." },
          { "id": "D", "label": "To sterilize the inlet gases." }
        ],
        "answerId": "B",
        "explanation": "As cell density increases, oxygen demand rises. Precise DO control prevents hypoxia, which can lead to cell death and reduced product yield."
      },
      {
        "id": "q7",
        "prompt": "What is the most likely cause of a sudden, sharp drop in the pH (media turns yellow) of your cell culture medium?",
        "options": [
          { "id": "A", "label": "Bacterial contamination" },
          { "id": "B", "label": "Fungal contamination" },
          { "id": "C", "label": "Mycoplasma contamination" },
          { "id": "D", "label": "The cells have consumed most of the nutrients and produced acidic metabolites." }
        ],
        "answerId": "D",
        "explanation": "A sudden drop is most commonly due to overgrowth and high metabolic activity of the cells themselves, producing lactic acid and CO2, indicating it's time to passage the cells."
